# Campy Coyote Manifesto

## Preamble

Campy Coyote is not an experiment, a trend, or a product of convenience.

It is a system built with intent.

Born from the philosophy of simplicity, resilience, and clarity, Campy Coyote
exists to serve those who value control over comfort, understanding over
abstraction, and reliability over excess.

Campy Coyote is a tool — sharp, lean, and dependable.

---

## 1. Purpose

Campy Coyote exists to provide a **stable, minimal, and developer-oriented
operating system** that respects the user’s autonomy.

It does not attempt to predict user behavior or impose workflows.

It provides a strong foundation and then gets out of the way.

---

## 2. Principles

### 2.1 Minimalism With Reason

Every component must justify its presence.

- No software is included for marketing, monetization, or trend-following.
- Features are added only when they provide measurable utility.
- Visual design favors clarity over decoration.

Minimalism is not austerity — it is precision.

---

### 2.2 Stability Is Non-Negotiable

Stability is treated as a core feature, not a convenience.

- Long-term support is prioritized.
- ABI compatibility is respected.
- Updates are conservative and predictable.
- Breakage is considered a failure, not an acceptable risk.

Reliability outweighs novelty.

---

### 2.3 User Sovereignty

The system belongs to the user.

- No forced package formats.
- No telemetry or behavioral tracking.
- No background services without clear purpose and explanation.

Users decide how Campy Coyote evolves on their machines.

---

### 2.4 Transparency by Default

Nothing is hidden.

- Configuration is readable and accessible.
- Tooling is open, documented, and inspectable.
- System behavior can be traced, understood, and modified.

If something cannot be explained, it does not belong.

---

### 2.5 Performance Is a Feature

Efficiency is mandatory.

- Low memory footprint.
- Fast boot and login times.
- Predictable resource usage.

Performance is achieved through discipline, not shortcuts.

---

## 3. What Campy Coyote Is Not

Campy Coyote is not:

- A rolling-release experiment
- A vendor-controlled ecosystem
- A heavily themed showcase
- A monetized platform
- A beginner-only abstraction layer

It does not chase novelty.  
It does not compete on noise.

---

## 4. Relationship to Upstream

Campy Coyote is based on Ubuntu, but it is not Ubuntu rebranded.

- Ubuntu provides the upstream foundation.
- Campy Coyote defines its own defaults, tooling, and policies.
- Divergence is intentional, minimal, and documented.

Upstream is respected. Downstream decisions are deliberate.

---

## 5. The Coyote Ethos

The coyote survives by being:

- Observant
- Adaptive
- Efficient
- Independent

Campy Coyote reflects this ethos in software form.

It thrives in constrained environments.  
It rewards understanding.  
It never pretends to be something it is not.

---

## 6. The Social Contract

Campy Coyote makes the following commitments:

1. The system will remain open source.
2. User control will not be traded for convenience.
3. Stability will not be sacrificed for attention.
4. Branding will never outweigh function.
5. The distribution will remain small, understandable, and honest.

In return, users are expected to:
- Learn
- Question
- Take responsibility for their systems

---

## 7. Closing Statement

Campy Coyote is for those who want a system that feels *earned*.

It does not hold your hand —  
but it does not betray you.

In a landscape crowded with noise, Campy Coyote chooses silence, speed,
and substance.

**Stay sharp. Stay light. Survive anywhere.**
